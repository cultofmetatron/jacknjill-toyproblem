# jacknjill-toyproblem
just a coding interview question

##Developer Test Question
  A bunch of kids are about to roll down a hill and they are deciding what order to roll in.
  Write a function that takes an array of names and modifies the array such that "jack"
  is always first, and "jill" is always second (because she came tumbling after).
  
  Show your (hopefully robust) test cases and state your assumptions
  Use any language - but bonus points for using coffee-script
  
  example 1: input = ['bob', 'jill', 'jack', 'amanda'], output ['jack', 'jill', 'bob', 'amanda']
  example 2: input = ['bob', 'jill', 'amanda'], output ['jill', 'bob', 'amanda']
  example 3: input = ['bob', 'jack', 'jill', 'jack', 'amanda'], output ['jack', 'jack', 'jill', 'bob', 'amanda']
